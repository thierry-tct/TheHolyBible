## How Does the Bible Describe Good/Bad?
> Mark 10:17-31 - Rich man calling Jesus good and asking what to do to inherit eternal life

> 1 Timothy 1:8-11 - Paul telling Timothy that the law is good and is for ungodly people

> Romans 7:12 - Paul saying that the law is good

> Matthew 22:36–40 - man asks Jesus about the greatest commandment

## We Can't Do It Anyway
Is There Anything That You Have To Do or Want To that You Did/Do Perfectly?
: There is nothing, however simple (be it our job, marriage, child care, ...)
: Now, what make us be known to it is the belief we have towards it. Hence, we give our best to it.

Similarly, we can't keep the law of God perfectly. However, the one who believe will give themselves to it, to love God and their neighbors.

> Galatians 2:16 - "Yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified"

## What Will Save in the End
The belief in God will make us embrace His gift of salvation.

> Galatians 2:16 - "Yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified"

> John 14:15 - “If you love Me, keep My commandments."

We can see genuineness by the practice; 1 John 3:4 - "Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness"

## Overall 
People today focus on the less commandment when defining good. That is, focus on the command toward our neighbor. 
Moreover, believer and many non-believers alike seem to agree about most of it, which make believers and non-believers alike think that non-believer are sometime better than believers in behaviors in behavior.

However, the most important command is ignored, discarded and blatantly thrown away by non-believers.

At the end, it is only in Jesus Christ that we are justified, and for good works.

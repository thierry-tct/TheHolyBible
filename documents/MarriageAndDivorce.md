# Marriage, Divorce and Remarriage
## Marriage
Everyone is free to marry or not.
> [1 Corinthians 7:8-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+7%3A8-9&version=NKJV)

## Divorce
God hates divorce, it is not His will.
> [Malachi 2:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Malachi+2%3A16&version=NKJV)

However, He permitted (was patient with people committing) it before, because of the hardening of the hearts.
> [Deuteronomy 24:1-4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+24%3A1-4&version=NKJV)


The only ground for divorce and remarriage is when one party commit adultery.
The victim, the one that did not break the marriage covenant through adultery, is free to divorce and remarry.
> [Matthew 5:32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A32&version=NKJV) \
> [Matthew 19:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2019%3A9&version=NKJV)

> [Jeremiah 3:6-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%203%3A6-8&version=KJV) (God Himself divorced Israel for her adultery).

Note that this is still not the perfect will of God, but the person that commits adultery somehow broke the covenant of marriage, whereby:
> [Genesis 1:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A27&version=NKJV) - So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them \
> [Genesis 2:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2%3A24&version=NKJV) - Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.

### Case of unbelieving spouse
Unlike believers marriages where God want us to do everything to stay faithful to the marriage covenant that God put between the spouses, by not breaking it by committing adultery or by simply divorcing for any other reason, as mentioned [above](#),
the Bible gives right to believer married to non-believer to be free to accept divorce from the unbeliever spouse in case they want to separate, with clear conscience. That is because the non-believer is separate from the way of the Lord and hence cannot be convinced by it.

However, the believer spouse should not seek divorce just because their spouse is non-believer, but instead seek to bring them to the faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.

Also, the believer cannot remarry unless their spouse committed adultery or remarried after their separation.
> [1 Corinthians 7:12-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+7%3A12-16&version=NKJV)

### Christian remarriage
Christians are free to remarry when their spouse passes away.
> [1 Corinthians 7:39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+7%3A39&version=NKJV)

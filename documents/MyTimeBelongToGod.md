## unexpected Waiting Time

[Colossians 3:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A23-24&version=NKJV), [1 Corinthians 10:31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2010%3A31&version=NKJV) and [Philippians 2:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+2%3A14&version=NLT).

### What is w0isted time according to God view

Let's say you live at a very remote place, where you spend long commuting time to work or church. Or, you need to make a connection during your commute and missed the connection, and have to stay at the connecting location for an extra hour to wait for the next connection.

This looks like a waiste of time doesn't it?

We often look at these scenarios as waste of time and complain about the situation. However, God does not look at them as waiste of time, as long as we do everything for Him in it, use everything for Jesus Christ.
These situations could be seen as waiste of time in the worldly angle, and if we are angered or greatly disturbeed by it, then, perhaps we are too worldly. 

A waste of time in God's eyes is when we forsake His kingdom and live our lives not for Jesus Christ but for other reasons (such as ourselves, others, career, worldly pleasures, ...). See [Ephesians 5:16-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205%3A16-17&version=NKJV) and [Colossians 4:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+4%3A5&version=NKJV).

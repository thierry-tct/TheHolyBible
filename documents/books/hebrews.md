# Hebrews

## Hebrews 3
### Jesus Superior to Moses (Verses 1 to 6)
- Moses was faithful, Jesus was also faithful
- Moses was great, but Jesus is greater. Jesus has greater glory than Moses, similarly to a builder that has more honor than the house.
- Moses, who is part of the house of God, was a servant. Jesus on the other hand is the son. The house, which is us Christians, belongs to Jesus.

### We should persevere until the end (verses 6, 12 to 14)
As christians, we should keep what we received until the end and not just say "I used to" or "I did ...". Instead we should continue to do our first works and have our first love (See letters to churches in Revelation).

If we don't keep until the end and harden our hearts, we will be doomed.

That is what happened to the people of Israel that perished in the desert. 

Hardening the heart is caused by the seduction of sin (verse 13). 

Evil and unbelieving hearts can lead to turning away from God. 

We are partakers of Christ if we remain steadfast until the end.

### We should not harden our hearts to the word of God (Verses 7-11 and 15-19)
Do not harden the hearts like the people in the Desert. This quotes Psalms 95:7-11.

The author repeats himself, probably to show the importance.

He takes the analogy of teh israelites perhapts to show something: The similarity with us.

1. The Israelites were in captivity just as we were to sin and death
2. The Israelite were saved through Moses, passing by the desert, to go to the promised land. We, after accepting to follow jesus, are free but not yet at the promised land, a bit like in the desert.
3. The promised land is like the new heaven and new earth in the future.

The israelite left Egypt to the desert (verse 16), similarly to the Christians on earth, us, the christians to whom the letter of Hebrews was written. However, in the desert, the became hard in their hearts and perished for that without entering the promised land (verse 17-19). The same way, if after becoming followers of jesus, we hearden our hearts, we will likewise perish and not enter God's rest.

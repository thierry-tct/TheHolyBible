## Some Key Passages

#### **Chapter 27**: This chapter talks about Paul's journey to Rome by ship. Paul advised to not leave the harbor near the city of Lasea.
- However, the centurion listened to the pilot and the ship's captain instead of Paul. Now there was a great tempest, which lasted many days (more than 2 weeks).
- They could not even see the sun or the stars for many days, for they were desperate. The people were desperate and did not eat for 14 days.
- An angel of the Lord appeared to Paul during the night, reassuring him that no one in the ship of 276 persons would die.
- LESSON: In the rest of the chapter, Paul who was a prisoner on that ship became the leader. That because he had the revelation and the Hope from God.
- A thing the other did not. Hence, Paul was strong and knowledgeable, while the others were desperate. 
When we serve Christ. We bring solution in time of darkness and guidance for the lost.
